Contao Category News Sorting
============================

Allows you to sort news items per category individually.

For each category there will be a new operation where you can individually sort the news items belonging to this exact
news category. Then in the news list module you can activate the __Enable category sorting__ setting which will apply
this custom sorting whenever the news list is filtered by the respective category.
